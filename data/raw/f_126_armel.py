def f_126(text):
    """
    Analyze a text by creating a document term matrix with CountVectorizer. The text contains several sentences, each separated by a period.
    Ignore empty sentences.

    Parameters:
    text (str): The text to analyze.

    Returns:
    DataFrame: A pandas DataFrame with the document-term matrix. Its column names should be adapted from the vectorizer feature names.

    Requirements:
    - pandas
    - regex
    - sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer

    Example:
    >>> text = "This is a sample sentence. This sentence contains sample words."
    >>> dtm = f_126(text)
    >>> print(dtm)
       contains  is  sample  sentence  this  words
